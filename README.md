# DSCI565-Group5-Project
This is the source code for the group project in DSCI-565 course from University of Southern California. The topic is "Training Deep Language Models for Tweets Sentiment Analysis". The scripts are written in Python language.
There are mainly four files in the respository. "data.csv" is the dataset we used for sentiment analysis. "bert.ipynb" is the Jupyter Notebook file we used to implement BERT model. "Data_Analysis.ipynb" is the Jupyter Notebook file we used to analyze the Twitter dataset.
When openning "bert.ipynb", please use Jupyter Notebook with PyTorch. Overall, we used four different ways to fine-tune BERT and they are all included in one file. You may adjust the annotations in appropriate lines to change the fine-tune method. You may add a "saved_dict" folder to save the model.
